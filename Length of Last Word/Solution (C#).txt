🧠 Intuition
The main idea is to start scanning the string from the end and count the length of the last word (a sequence of non-space characters).  
Once we hit a space *after* counting at least one character, we know the last word has ended.

Approach
1. Start iterating from the end of the string.  
2. If the current character is not a space (' '), increment the counter and set a flag to indicate we’re inside a word.  
3. If the current character is a space and the flag is true, it means we’ve already counted the last word, so we can stop.  
4. Finally, return the counter as the length of the last word.

⏱️ Complexity
    Time complexity: 
 O(n) — we traverse the string once, from end to start.  

    Space complexity:  
 O(1) — only a few variables are used; no extra space proportional to the input size.

💻 Code
csharp
public class Solution {
    public int LengthOfLastWord(string s) {
        bool flag = false;
        int counter = 0;
        for (int i = s.Length - 1; i >= 0; i--)
            if (s[i] != 32)
            {
                counter++;
                flag = true;
            }
            else if (s[i] == 32 && flag == true)
                break;
        return counter;
    }
}
